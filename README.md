TiX Time Core contains the core data types and encoders to be used in the Client and Server. It is made in this way to ensure compatibility between both repositories and to segregate even more the concerns of each class.

## Instalation instructions

This library is intended to be used by the components within the TiX Time Computing layer. As such, there is no installation mechanism aside from using the dependency managers. You can find it in this link [https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.tix-measurements/tix-time-core](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.tix-measurements/tix-time-core).
